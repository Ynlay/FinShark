Created to practice on .NET and SQL Server Management Studio 

More specifically this project is showcasing CRUD on an API level and using Entity Framework 

Some noteable aspects of this project: 
1. DTOs to cut down on what the user sees from the database
2. Connecting to SQL Server and creating database tables from code using the "dotnet ef migrations add init" command and "dotnet ef database update"
3. Using OOP and MVC principles for project folder structure
